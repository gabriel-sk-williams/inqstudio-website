Since most residents of Los Angeles are dependent on their cars, residential developers are forced to building expensive parking garages and pass along the cost to their tenants. The only way to break the cycle of auto-centricity is to build denser housing and promote walkabilityâ€”by locating existing garages and referencing them with recent construction trends, Six Peak Capital could run improved calculations on the possibility of reduced parking.",

Racial tensions were crystallized in the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's Infamous 1939 'redlining' surveys, shown here overlayed by the 1955 'Yellow Book' drawing for the implementation of the Federal Aid Highway ACt. Notably, Detroit's 'Black Bottom' neighborhood was utterly dismembered by the construction of I-75 in the 60's and 70's [Aerial photos: 1949 and 1981].",

No surprise then, that Overtown was slated for redevelopment as part of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956. There is a strong pattern of minority communities being razed for new Interstates across the US.",
